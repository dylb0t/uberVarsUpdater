# uberVarsUpdater
Updates ubercombat inc file for whenever Shroom adds new vars.

Currently it will not ask. All it does is copy new variables into a merged file. It retains anything you have set in your current file and adds the same values Shroom put in his version.

# Usage
- Create subdirectories Configs > "Existing", "UberLatest" and "Merged".
- Note that directories will auto-create on first run, however you still will need to put your config in the Existing directory.
- Put your config in the "Existing" directory.
- Put shroom's latest in "UberLatest" directory.
- Note a copy is included but not guaranteed to be the latest
- Run

A file will then be created in the Merged directory. Copy this to your scripts folder.
